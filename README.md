# MyReadBooksFront

## Purpose of the application
Until now I have kept track of the books I have read using an Excel document. As long as the list of books read is increasing I find I could obtain some extra data, for example how many new authors I read each year.
My goal is that this application substitute the Excel document and all the tedious work I have to do every time I add a book.
